### Make sure each line has a max of 80 chars
### Queue Implementation
In *queue.c*, we used a doubly linked list to implement the queue, where each node has a pointer to the next and previous node. We felt like a doubly linked list would be more sufficient and flexible than an array.
- *queue_create* allocates memory for the queue and initializes the head and tail of the list. *queue_destroys* on the other hand, deallocates the queue's memory.
- *queue_enqueue* creates a new node and adds it at the end of the list by linking it with the tail node through *prev* and *next* variables.
- *queue_delete* iterates through the list until it finds a match. When it does it links the previous node and next node and then deallocates the memory created by the corresponding node.
- *queue_iterate* iterates through the array and execute the given function with each element in the queue.
### Queue Tester
*queue_tester* file contains 19 testcases in order to detect any error in the *queue* implementation. We created testcases for each aspect of every function in the *queue* API.
- *queue_destroy* function is tested when itâ€™s supposed to succeed, when queue is not empty, and when queue is NULL.
- *queue_enqueue* and *queue_dequeue* are tested via several functions in the tester. It tests both functions with both large and small number of elements. It does this by checking if *queue_dequeue* removes the right element and if all elements were added or removed using *queue_length*. In addition, it also handles edge cases when the queue is NULL or empty.
- *queue_delete* is tested with both large and small elements. As well as, edge cases such as a NULL queue or data. In addition, it also tests that the first element is deleted if there are duplicates.
- *queue_iterate* is tested with two functions *even_to_zero* and *odd_to_zero*. 
    - *odd_to_zero* changes elements with odd values to zero and deletes elements with even values. The tester, therefore, tests if even elements were successfully deleted and all odd elements were successfully changed to zero.
    - *even_to_zero* only changes elements with even values to zero, without deleting any element.

### Challenges/Limitations Faced
One of the challenges we faced is with implementing user-level thread library API. It was difficult to try to imagine how threads would be run since it is a relatively new concept to us. In addition, integrating the functions given to us in our API implementation without being able to see some of the functions' implementation. Another challenged we faced is having to figure out a bug that was occurring in a function used by *uthread_ctx_switch*.
