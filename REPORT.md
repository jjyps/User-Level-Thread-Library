### Queue Implementation
In *queue.c*, we used a doubly linked list to implement the queue, where each node has a pointer to the next and previous node. We felt like a doubly linked list would be more sufficient and flexible than an array.
- *queue_create* allocates memory for the queue and initializes the head and tail of the list. *queue_destroys* on the other hand, deallocates the queue's memory.
- *queue_enqueue* creates a new node and adds it at the end of the list by linking it with the tail node through *prev* and *next* variables.
- *queue_delete* iterates through the list until it finds a match. When it does it links the previous node and next node and then deallocates the memory created by the corresponding node.
- *queue_iterate* iterates through the array and execute the given function with each element in the queue.

### Queue Tester
*queue_tester* file contains 19 testcases in order to detect any error in the *queue* implementation. We created testcases for each aspect of every function in the *queue* API.
- *queue_destroy* function is tested when itâ€™s supposed to succeed, when queue is not empty, and when queue is NULL.
- *queue_enqueue* and *queue_dequeue* are tested via several functions in the tester. It tests both functions with both large and small number of elements. It does this by checking if *queue_dequeue* removes the right element and if all elements were added or removed using *queue_length*. In addition, it also handles edge cases when the queue is NULL or empty.
- *queue_delete* is tested with both large and small elements. As well as, edge cases such as a NULL queue or data. In addition, it also tests that the first element is deleted if there are duplicates.
- *queue_iterate* is tested with two functions *even_to_zero* and *odd_to_zero*. 
    - *odd_to_zero* changes elements with odd values to zero and deletes the 9th element. The tester, therefore, tests if the 9th element was successfully deleted, and all odd elements were successfully changed to zero.
    - *even_to_zero* only changes elements with even values to zero, without deleting any element.

### Uthread API
Implementation of user level thread library which manages the scheduling of threads' context executions. In *uthread_start* which initially starts the multithreading library along with *uthread_yield*, the current thread is an *idle* thread, behavior of initial access point of the process. 
- *uthread_create* first allocates the new memory and properties to the *new_thread* of ready state and then enqueues into the queue, *threads*.
- *uthread_yield* switches between the current thread which will become the previous thread and be enqueued into the *threads* and the next thread which will need to be dequeued from *threads* and become the current thread. We make sure the *prev_thread* is no longer in running state but in ready state and the *next_thread* to become the running thread; And then, we switch two threads using *uthread_ctx_switch*.
- *uthread_start* initialize the queue, *threads*, which is a container of the multi threads and create an idle thread with *uthread_ctx_t*. Set created idle thread as current thread and change the state to running state and we make sure the idle thread not to be returnned until all of the rest threads finishes.
- *uthread_exit* makes the state of current thread to *terminated* and then yield to the next thread.

### Semaphore API
In order to control the access to the common  resourcess  by multiple threads, we need semaphore to keep track of numbers of available resources.
- *struct_semaphore* has *queue_blocked* which is the queue of the waiting threads which are in blocked states and not eligible for the scheduling and *count*, an internal counter, to keep track of numbers of available resources.
- *sem_create* initiates and allocates new memory for the new semaphore with *count* and return the pointer.
- *sem_destroy* checks whether there are threads still being blocked or the memory is NULL; otherwise, deallocate the semaphore.
- *sem_up* releases the resource from the semaphore which increase the number of available reosource, *count++*. If the waiting list of threads is not empty, then the first, oldest, thread gets unblocked by using Uthread API, *uthread_unblock(first thread)*.
- *sem_down* takes the resource from the semaphore which decrease the number of available resource, *count--*. If there is no available resource, the requesting thread will get blocked using Uthread API, *uthread_block()*.

### Preemption
- *preempt_start* uses a sigaction struct. It assignes timer_interrupt_handler function to the struct's handler. Which yields to the next thread if an interruption occurs and it sets up an alarm such that the frequency of the preemption is 100 HZ. 
- *preempt_stops* returns the default action of the signal. It does this by setting the flag to *SA_RESETHAND*.
- *preempt_disable*/*preempt_enable* block/unblock the signal *SIGVTALRM* by creating a sigset and adding *SIGVTALRM* to the set. It uses the function *sigprocmask* & SIG_BLOCK/SIG_UNBLOCK to block/unblock the alarm signal.

### Preemption Tester
For preemption tester, there are 2 function testers. One for *preempt_enable* & *preempt_disable* and the other one is for *preempt_start* and *preempt_stop*. There are only 2 testers for these two functions because they work hand in hand. 
- *test_preempt_start_and_stop* tests whether the alarm started or not. First it creates 2 threads both with infinite loops to make sure that the threads dont return before testing is finished. It then saves the current thread in a temporary value using *uthread_current*. It then starts the preemption and after recieving a signal checks whether it yielded to the next thread. *preempt_stop* on the other hand is tested by doing the opposite, by yielding first and then checking whether the current thread is the first thread.
- *test_preempt_disable_and_enable* tests whether the signal was succesfully blocked/unblocked. It does this by creating 2 threads then calling *preempt_disable* which is supposed to block any *SIGVTALRM* signals. It then raises the signal, *raise* return value should not be equal to zero. It tests *preempt_enable* on the other hand by checking if *raise* return value is zero.

### Challenges/Limitations Faced
One of the challenges we faced is with implementing user-level thread library API. It was difficult to try to imagine how threads would be run since it is a relatively new concept to us. In addition, integrating the functions given to us in our API implementation without being able to see some of the functions' implementation. 

Another challenge we faced is having to figure out a bug that was occurring in a function used by *uthread_ctx_switch*. We have been kept getting *Segfault* from *uthread_ctx_switch* which turns out to be we forgot to check the state of the threads and also, we were not properly considering the *idle thread* which is the first, main thread that is used as an entry point to the process and must not be returned untill all the rest threads finishes.
